It is based on the PythonBrowser example from PyObjC.

Developed on OSX 10.4, Xcode 2.5, pyobjc 1.4, py2app 0.53

Prerequisites:
- python 2.7 - older versions may work
- PyobjC
- py2app
- Apple developer tools



It's flakey, buggy and a lot of fun.

Don't use it to save your current data. Just to watch it and get a new pov on opml.

This started as an excercise to learn about the NSOutlineView. Well one thing lead to another...


Things that work:

# files, outlines and tables
- open file (opml)
- open url (opml)
- new outline
- new table



Things that don't work:

- open document via open event or the dock
- rss
- save (only save as)
- saving when outline structure does not conform to opml (head & body element)
- node movements up & down
- cut, copy & paste



Shortcuts:
# open/save files
cmd-O       open file dialog
cmd-alt-O   open URL dialog
cmd-shift-S save as dialog

# editing
tab         indent selection
shift-tab   outdent selection

backspace   delete selection
delete      delete selection


cmd-enter   open node in a table view (usefull if node has attributes)

cmd-alt-enter
            try to open node selection either in a new document (opml include) or in the schema handler.
            does not work on impropper encoded urls.            

enter       start/end editing current node
Return      create a new node after the current and start editing
