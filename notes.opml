   <outline text="Unify node opening">
     <outline text="node opening grew out of opening rss items. New types were added as needed and now it's a big confusing case statement." />
    <outline text="opennode should get a url dict with baseURL, path &amp; query" />
    <outline text="Nodes should be pre-loaded anyway. That's the only way to determine the file type. CactusOutlineDocument should get a cacheURL attribute." />

     <outline text="The current event handling during text entry is a mess. It kind of works but is counter intuitive and ugly. Vision needed." />
   </outline>
   <outline text="row height calculation">
     <outline text="More accuracy without getting slow. The calculation should include column width." />
   </outline>
   <outline text="OPML: cactus needs/should have a head property to store it's own settings like column widths, columns enabled, max row lines." />
  </outline>
  <outline text="Bugs">
    <outline text="Saving a document while in editing mode does not save the edited cell." />
   <outline text="Update &quot;head&quot; section after save. This is not critical but things like expansion state calculated while writing and the head section should reflect that." />
  </outline>
  <outline text="Ideas">
    <outline text="Minimize memory usage for nodes" />
   <outline text="The idea is to minimize the ObjC OutlineNode to functions and a pointer to the at import created python dict." />
